## Saftey Warning

- Always keep your ESP32 in the anti-static bag when not in use. It's good practice for students to earth themselves before handling it. 
- Please handle your ESP32 by its edges. This minimises the risk of damage through an electrostatic discharge. 
- Please avoid handling the ESP32 circuit board while plugged into a power supply. 
- All peripherals (for example: USB cable, battery holder, sensors) used with your ESP32 should comply with the relevant standards and should be marked accordingly.
- Connecting your ESP32 to any unapproved peripherals could damage your ESP32. 
- Please do not attempt to keep using faulty ESP32.
- The maximum current safely supplied to an external circuit using the 3V pin is 100mA. Please make sure this limit is not exceeded. 
- Please do not store or use your ESP32 in extremely hot or cold environments. 
- Do not place any metal objects across the printed circuits on the board as this can cause a short circuit damaging your ESP32. This can cause risk of burn or fire. 
- Do not use your ESP32 in water or with wet hands. 
- Do not leave your ESP32 plugged into a computer or any other device unsupervised.
- Please do not leave your ESP32 within reach of children under 8 years of age.
